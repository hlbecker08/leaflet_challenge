# leaflet_challenge

For this challenge, we are creating a visualization for real-time earthquake data using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML can be found in the repo. The CSS and JS files are in the 'static' folder. The earthquake data can be accessed in JavaScript through this link: "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson".

For the visualization, we used Leaflet to display a map. We chose to center it near the San Andreas Fault, where there are the most earthquakes in North America. For each earthquake, a circle is placed on the map, with its size referencing the magnitude. The higher the magnitude, the larger the circle. The circle also has a color range depicting the depth at which the earthquake occurred. There is a legend on the map displaying the depth range based on the color.

I worked with Conner Dekok on this project and referenced ChatGPT for assistance in creating the visualization.
